Docker main concepts
  1)Docker is platform for devolping,deploying and testing an application in different environment in a rapid way
  2)docker virutualise the host application layer whereas a virtual machine virtualises the kernal of a host
  usually an operating system made of two layers one is kernal layer and an application layer below that there will be an hardware resource where kernal 


  note - it is recomended to map a port on which the container is running while running a container

1)Dockerfile
2)Docker images
3)Docker containers
4)Docker networking
5)Docker volume
6)Docker compose
7)Docker swarm
8)Docker Build
9)Docker swarm


1)Dockerfile creation
it is text file which contains instructions from which we create a docker immages.
info
FROM python:3.1
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN apt get install curl
EXPOSE 8000
ENV hostname="devaraja" /
CMD ["python","app.py"]

with this dockerfile and source code of an application we can build docker image with command called
docker build -t python-img .

after this step we will get an image
from this image we can build a container

cmd -  Docker run -d -p 80:80 image_name

where image is read only file with executable template to create container

step -1 - some of the basic commands of docker
1)Docker build -t myimage .
2)Docker run -d -p 80:80 myimage
3)Docker images - to list out the image lists
4)docker ps - to list out the running containers
5)docker ps -a - to list out the running and not running containers
6)docker start c_name
7)docker stop c_name
8)docker image rmi image-name
9)docker container rm c_name
10)docker network create network-name
11)docker
